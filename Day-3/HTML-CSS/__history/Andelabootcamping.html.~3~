<p><i>About the author: Anurag Mishra is pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation from United College of Engineering and Research, Allahabad. He signed up on Internshala VTC for the Core Java online training. He recounts his experience of the training program and how he finally started loving programming.</i></p> 
<p>The way I started loving programming is quite accidental and Internshala played a beautiful role in it. It was my summer vacations after B.tech 2nd year, and I was planning to undertake a software course as I was feeling hopeless in my core branch subjects of Electronics and Instrumentation. However, I suffered a leg injury and could not enroll in any course. This was depressing as despite my strong desire, I could not go to any institute to attend classes. After recovering, I went to college and surfed the net seeking online courses that would save my travelling time so that I could manage the time between college and extra courses, and that’s how I came to know about Internshala Virtual Training Centre (VTC). I paid the fees next day itself and got enrolled for the six-week Java training program. I reckon that it was one of the best decisions I had taken till date as I was extremely happy with the time I spent with Internshala and would strongly recommend it to everyone.</p>
 <p>My training on Java spanned over a period of 6 weeks, divided into three modules, and punctuated by tests after each module. The content was simple and to the point – exactly what a student really wants. The difficulty level increased gradually but the live chat, online forum, and the constant support from VTC team kept the training steady and easy.</p> 
<p>I spent almost one to one and half hours every day on Java, and with every passing day, I started loving it. The way this training was designed, it gave me the perfect kick start and fueled my interest to keep going forward throughout the duration of the training. The tutorials were perfectly comprehensive. The exercises at the end of the tutorials were fun and confidence boosters. The assignments were great too; they made me think about the things which I would learn in the next chapter or the next module and enhanced my grip on programming.
<p>Having to do a project at the end of the course is a badass idea. It checks what all you had learnt from the training. It was not easy to complete, but it put a smile on my face once I completed it. I had to employ everything I had learnt in those six weeks. One major problem I faced during the training was that my exams got scheduled before I could take the final test. I wrote an email to the VTC team and, within few hours, I got an extension of two weeks even though I had asked only for ten days. I was delighted by their gesture and the way they took care of the students. I feel proud to confess it that the people at Internshala are very supportive and thorough professionals.
